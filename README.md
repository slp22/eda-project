# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
Course Project Introduction
### Summary
Say that you'd like to do some data work for an organization, but they aren't hiring. They might not even know that they could benefit from the data science services of a skilled practitioner like you. How can you get their attention?

For this project, you are going to deliver a preliminary analysis to your target organization ("client") to try to get your foot in the door. Your job is to lay out a case that your skills and insights are useful for their unique needs.

To do this, you will take advantage of free, accessible data about the patterns of transit traffic in New York City: MTA turnstile data (Links to an external site.). Using this data source, as well as any other relevant dataset(s) of your choosing, perform an exploratory analysis in Python and SQL that offers insightful and actionable quantitative findings (including visualizations) to your client. Communicate your process and findings in a 5-minute presentation during Week 4, and include a short written description.

### Your Backstory
This is a fairly free-form project, and creativity is welcome. The client organization can be real or imaginary, a private company or a social sector group, anything you desire. For instance, you may decide that a non-profit organization has approached you, soliciting your help. Here is an example email that a former group "received" from a non-profit.

#### Components
Metis projects are broken down into 5 component parts -- design, data, algorithms, tools, and communication -- that are each scored individually. Below is a description of each component as it relates to this project. For more detail on how these components are graded and how extra points are rewarded, refer to the project success guide.

#### Design:
The project should include a clearly defined backstory that satisfies a specific need for the client organization. It should be centered around discovering useful, actionable insights for your client, informed by the movement of people in the city.
All deliverable deadlines should be met, reflecting professionalism and effective scoping and workflow
#### Data
The primary data source should be MTA turnstile data
After we cover SQLite, you can follow these MTA data retrieval instructions (with this get_mta.py file)
You MUST use MTA turnstile data for this project.  Any project that does not utilize MTA turnstile data will receive a score of zero.
Aim to use at least 3 months worth of data; consult with an instructor if you are considering deviating from this rule of thumb, which may vary depending on your use case
You are welcome and encouraged to incorporate any additional, relevant data sources
#### Algorithms
Perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis of the MTA turnstile data; clean, explore, aggregate, and visualize the data as appropriate to address the client's problem
The MTA Analysis Exercises 1, 2, and 3, which we'll cover over the next few days, will help you get started with your data exploration
#### Tools
Ingesting the raw data into a SQL database and querying from that database into Python via SQLAlchemy is required; exploratory analysis and data cleaning in SQL is optional
Exploratory data analysis in pandas is required
Python visualization libraries (such as Matplotlib and Seaborn) are required
Other tools not covered in the course are optional but welcome
Major examples of applicable tools not covered in the course:
Processing tools could include Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services for cloud computing resources
Visualization tools could include more advanced python libraries such as Bokeh and Plotly or resources outside of python such as Tableau
Communication:
Students will deliver a 5-minute slide presentation at the end of the course. These should be given in a compelling, clear manner and include effective visuals for communicating your objectives and findings. Use this as a guide for putting together your slides.
You will also submit a ~1-page written description summarizing your work: it should begin with a ~100-word abstract to be followed by a breakdown of your project along with the 5 major components. For guidance on writing an effective abstract check out this resource (Links to an external site.).
#### Deliverables:
Please submit all project deliverables through Canvas.
For exact deliverable dates, refer to the main schedule.
